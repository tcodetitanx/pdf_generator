                <li>(a) The term of this Service Agreement is for three (3) years. This one year period shall begin on the date services are scheduled to begin.
                        This Service Agreement shall automatically extend for additional one (1) year periods, unless at least thirty (30) days prior to each anniversary of the date services are scheduled to begin, either party gives the other written notice of its intent not to renew.

                <li>CUSTOMER agrees that it will not employ or contract with any $contract_provider employee, franchisee, or any of the franchisee's employees during the term of this Service Agreement or for one hundred and eighty (180) days after termination of this Service Agreement, without $contract_provider's written consent.</li> <br> 
                <li>$contract_provider will bill CUSTOMER monthly, and CUSTOMER agrees to pay $contract_provider the amount that is due and owing under the terms of this Service Agreement within 10 days of billing date. Late payments will incur service and finance charges. In the event of default on payment, CUSTOMER agrees to pay $contract_provider's attorney's fees and costs for collection.</li> <br>

Services shall be scheduled during the hours approved or directed by manager/owner.</li> <br> 
                <li>If "Additional Special Services" are included in the $contract_provider Service Plan attached to this Service Agreement, and if CUSTOMER cancels any periodic Special Services described therein for which a prorated monthly charge is included in CUSTOMER'S total monthly Service Charge, any amount owing by CUSTOMER for Special Services performed prior to the cancellation shall be payable in full no later than five (5) days after the cancellation.</li> <br> 
                <li>The undersigned warrant and represent that they have full authority to enter into this Service Agreement, and that it will be binding upon the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Specifically, CUSTOMER acknowledges that this Service Agreement may be assigned in its entirety to a $contract_provider, a subcontractor or another third party.</li> <br> 
                <li>This Service Agreement and attached exhibits constitute the complete agreement of the parties concerning the provision of cleaning services to the CUSTOMER, and supersedes all other prior or contemporaneous agreements between the parties, whether written or oral, on the same subject.
